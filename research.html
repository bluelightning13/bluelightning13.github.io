        <h2>Thesis</h2>
        <h3>Non-invasive methods for glucose monitoring feasiable for use by diabetic patients</h3>
        <p> 
		My thesis research is about determining if optics is a feasible clinical method for measuring blood glucose levels.
        </p>
        <h2> Other Research</h2>
		<p>
			Other research I have done is on my senior year project (Dynamically Adjusting Prostetic Socket) with three other people, we designed a prostetic socket that would adjust it's grip depending on if a user was walking or sitting. This was to reduce the restriction of blood and sores that occur from wearing prostetics. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently I am assisting with the MRI surgical robot in the WPI AIM lab. This robot is designed to perform brain surgeries within an MRI. This would allow doctors to see that they are doing on an MRI, giving them better vision, and making the procedure less invasive.
