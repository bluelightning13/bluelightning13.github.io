<span class="heading">Hydroponics:</span> 
<span class="ptext">where plants are not grown in soil - only water, nutrients and light are used. <span>

This idea was mentioned to me by my boyfriend Don, who was interested in building a hydroponics system 
when he got a house. He was talking about the carbon filtering systems and having a huge mylar tent...and I 
thought starting small would be a good first step.
</span>
<br/>
<span class="ptext">
I got this small hydroponics kit off Amazon for around $40 for him. We also stopped at a local hydroponics supply
store and got other supplies - all for under $100 except for the LED light source.

The nets (the plastic pieces that contain the plant roots) were under a dollar. Ph balancing chemicals were around $15. 
The plastic bin that hold the water was ~$3.

The light was the main cost - around $200. This cost actually drove me to create my Custom Lighting Project.
</span>

The light was very bright - good for the plant, but bad for our eyes and it weighed a bit. So it needed a good stand. 
But we didn't want to spend a lot on one, so we made one:

I ended up making the wood frame (thanks to Don's dad who had a chop saw!) and stained it. This would support the 
light and the wood you can use for this is cheap compared to store bought stands.

Next I made the mylar sides. I got some material that looked good and was on sale. It was a little hard to sew the doors
beacuse I didn't have much of that material so cutting it was a little awkward - but it all came out very well.
Even if you are new to sewing with a machine or have not used mylar in sewing it was really easy.

You can also just pin the mylar to the material. This blocks most of the light from your eyes and reflects it back to the plants.
It's a win win!
