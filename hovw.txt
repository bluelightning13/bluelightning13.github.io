This idea was mentioned to me by my boyfriend Don, who was interested in building a hydroponics system 
when he got a house. He was talking about the carbon filtering systems and having a huge mylar tent...and I 
thought starting small would be a good first step.

I got this small hydroponics kit off Amazon for around $40 for him. We also stopped at a local hydroponics supply
store and got other supplies - all for under $100 except for the LED light source.

The nets (the plastic pieces that contain the plant roots) were under a dollar. Ph balancing chemicals were around $15. 
The plastic bin that hold the water was ~$3.

The light was the main cost - around $200. This cost actually drove me to create my Custom Lighting Project.
